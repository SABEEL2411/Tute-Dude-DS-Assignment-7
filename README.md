# Module 27 – Cardiac Diagnostics Case Study
---
## Objective
---
In this module, you will apply machine learning techniques to build a Cardiac Disease Prediction Model. The goal is to analyze patient health data and predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes.
---
## Reference
---
Watch the Module 27 video carefully. The concepts and workflow explained in the video will guide you in completing this case study step by step.
---
## Dataset
---
You can use the Heart Disease Prediction dataset available on Kaggle.
 Search for “Heart Disease UCI” or “Cardiac Diagnosis Dataset”.
---
## 🧩 Task Instructions
---
- Import and explore the dataset (understand features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.).
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing:
- Handle missing values (if any)
- Encode categorical variables
- Normalize or standardize data if needed
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Implement a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or KNN) to predict heart disease.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Write a brief summary of your analysis and key findings.

## 💾 Submission Requirements
---
- Submit your .ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook).
- Upload your notebook to Google Colab and share the Colab link
